# drip-rip
Tool for ripping all your downloads from drip.com

This requires Python and requests to run

If you don't have Python installed, this can be helpful (make sure you install pip too!):

# Bugs
Currently there is no way to filter on a certain drip, this is unlikely to be added b/c I don't have that many

If this crashes while downloading a file, it will be corrupted and you will need to redownload it manually

It currently does not check if files are already downloaded, so it will download them again and overwrite them if you restart the scan. I will hopefully fix this.
